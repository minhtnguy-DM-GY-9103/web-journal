## UI Sketches

### Sketch 1

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<img src="/web-journal/assets/images/sketches/sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketch 1" width="400"/>
</div>

In this layout, the images are clustered into different groups, based on different image categories classified by the AI. The user would be able to click on a group to view the images in that group.

### Sketch 2

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<img src="/web-journal/assets/images/sketches/sketch2.jpg" alt="Sketch 2" width="400"/>
</div>

This layout is similar to a dating app, where the user can swipe left or right to view different images and save the ones they like. I would then use AI to analyze the selected images.

### Sketch 3

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<img src="/web-journal/assets/images/sketches/sketch3.jpg" alt="Sketch 3" width="400"/>
</div>

In this layout, it is a basic image gallery layout, where the user can click left and right to navigate through the images to view the previous and next image. Here the AI just provides image tags and the colors extracted from the image.
<br><br>

### Sketch 4

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<img src="/web-journal/assets/images/sketches/sketch4.jpg" alt="Sketch 4" width="400"/>
</div>

In this sketch, the images would be displayed in a grid layout, but there is an input field where the user can input what they are working on or the theme they desire. Then, the images would be classified and filtered based on the input.

### Sketch 5

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<img src="/web-journal/assets/images/sketches/sketch5.jpg" alt="Sketch 5" width="400"/>
</div>
Here, the user would be able to drag and drop images they like to the right section, and these images would then be analyzed with AI.

## User Feedback

For user feedback, I talked to 5 people, and asked them for their initial impressions of the different sketches.

Overall, the users were most intrigued by the swiping interface but were unsure of how the AI interaction would be incoporated into this interface. Some suggestions included were using AI to analyze the selected images at the end or using AI to build an algorithm based on the user's preferences.

For some of the other sketches, the users were unsure how the AI interaction would be helpful. Some questions they asked were: How can I use this information in my work? How would when I don't have a clear project and I don't know what I want to work on? Does the AI learn my preferences over time?

For the final protoype, I plan to explore the swiping interface more, and incorporate the AI interaction into the interface with the selected images. I want to use the metadata of the images, like the tags and extracted colors, to build a visualization connecting the images to each other.
