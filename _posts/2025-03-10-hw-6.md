# Project Summary

For this project, I want to explore how to more effectively categorize and retrieve visual inspiration for different creative projects, addressing the challenge of how to manage overwhelming amounts of media.

Designers tend to collect different types of inspiration for certain projects or to reference in the future, such as images or videos. They can build up a large archive of inspiration over time, but it can be difficult to find the specific inspiration they need when they need it.

Many times, people will search through their entire collection of inspiration to find the specific reference they need and some references will never even be used. One current solution to this problem is to use folders to organize inspiration such as by theme or color, but this can be time-consuming and difficult to maintain.

My key research question is: **How might we improve the process of saving and organizing visual inspiration for creative individuals using AI?**

# UX Research

For my research, I conducted 2 interviews with design students and 1 observation, where I observed a designer finding inspiration for a project.

During my interviews, I found that designers collect inspiration from many different sources, such as Instagram, Pinterest, or random screenshots. Some platforms, such as Pinterest, allow users to categorize content immediately when saving an image, but other sources, such as Instagram, do not. If there is a multi-step process to categorize inspiration, they will often not do so, as there is increased friction to organize media.

From my observation, I prompted a designer to start designing their personal portfolio, and how they would begin to find inspiration for their portfolio. As they began to search for inspiration, they went to Dribbble to look for examples and LinkedIn to find portfolios of other designers in the industry. Then they would then take screenshots and create a Figma file to add all their screenshots to. During this process, the screenshots they took varied in style, however they did not choose to categorize them in the Figma file, as they mentioned that it would be too time-consuming and they wanted their portfolio to use bits and pieces of different screenshots they collected.

Overall, from my interviews and observations, I found that the key pain points of the current experience of finding and saving inspiration are:

1. Many designers have a "hoarding mentality," saving content they might never use but are hesitant to delete.
2. Designers struggle to find specific inspiration when starting a new project, as they have saved inspiration from many different sources with different styles.
3. Designers often struggle to categorize their inspiration, as it is time-consuming and there is sometimes a lot of friction.

The emotional needs not being met include the desire for effortless organization and the satisfaction of actually using saved content. Functionally, users need a system that simplifies categorization and enables efficient retrieval for all of their archived inspiration.

# Cognitive Offloading Matrix

Based on my user journey map and 2x2 matrix, I found that the two moments in my user experience that are best suited to cognitive offloading through AI are:

1. When a designer is searching for inspiration for a new project, they can use AI to search through their entire collection of inspiration to find the most relevant inspiration.
2. When a designer is saving inspiration, they can use AI to automatically categorize the inspiration based on the project they are working on.

These two moments are best suited to cognitive offloading through AI because they are the moments where the user is most likely to be overwhelmed by the amount of inspiration they have collected and the most likely to benefit from AI's ability to search and categorize inspiration.

# Potential Solutions

1. An AI tool that can reorganize inspiration based on the project the designer is working on. This could be used when a designer is working on a new project, and this would reduce the cognitive load of reorganizing their inspiration based on the project they are working on. This would help designers revisit pieces of inspiration that they may have forgotten about or had saved for a different project. For this solution, I would use an image classification model to analyze the style of the inspiration and then reorganize the inspiration into different categories based on the project.

2. An AI tool that can automatically suggest categories to save inspiration in, based on the style or theme of the inspiration. This tool would be used when a designer is saving inspiration from somewhere, and this would reduce the cognitive load of choosing which category to save the inspiration in or having to create a new category. For this solution, I could use an image to text model and suggest categories based on the generated text.

3. If you upload an image or use your camera to take a photo, the AI can automatically suggest types of inspiration that you can use for your project, based on your collection or new externals sources. For this solution, I would use an image to text model to generate a description of the image and then use a text to image model to generate types of inspiration that you can use for your project.
