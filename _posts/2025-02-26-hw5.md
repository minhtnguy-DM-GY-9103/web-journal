#### User Interviews

For my design research, I conducted user interviews with 2 people. I asked them about their experiences with digital collaboration tools and how they interact with others online.

**Interview 1**

- 23F
- Tell me about the last time you used a digital collaboration tool?
  - uses Zoom for meetings
  - everyone is familar with zoom
  - so engrained in work culture now
- How do you currently initiate spontaneous interactions in digital spaces?
  - text messages, can easily message a friend
    - more comfortable doing spotaneous things with people you know
    - less intimidating than reaching out to coworkers or strangers
- What role do you think AI could play in making digital collaboration/interactions feel more natural?
  - maybe AI can help with the awkwardness of reaching out to strangers
    - icebreakers or grouping people by common interests
    - prompts for conversation starters
- What would an ideal digital collaborative experience look like for you?
  - more casual interactions
  - icebreakers for strangers

**Interview 2**

- 24F
- Tell me about the last time you used a digital collaboration tool?
  - figma for design team work
  - able to collaborate in real time
  - can see what others are working on
  - favorite features: spotlight tool, comments
    - spotlight tool: makes it easy to quickly jump to a specific part of the design
    - comments: can leave comments for asynchronous conversations
- How do you currently initiate spontaneous interactions in digital spaces?
  - on zoom, can just start talking to people
    - hard to know when is a good time to unmute yourself
  - sending messages on slack
    - love using emoji reactions on slack, really easy to express emotions
- What role do you think AI could play in making digital collaboration/interactions feel more natural?
  - not really sure how AI can help
  - value natural interactions, feel like AI can take away from that
- What would an ideal digital collaborative experience look like for you?
  - maybe a tool that combines zoom, figma, and slack
  - hate screensharing and switching contexts from zoom to figma
  - access to any tool that you need to collaborate
