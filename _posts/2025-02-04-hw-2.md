# Homework 2

For this homework, I trained a teachable machine to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer. I created about 600 images for each hand gesture and used them to train the model. Then I used the model to play against the computer. The computer's choice was randomly generated. I would then take the result of each player to determine the winner.

The way I trained the model was by taking pictures of each hand gesture and labeling them as either rock, paper, or scissors. When training the model, I moved my face out of the frame to avoid it being included in the training data. However, when playing the game, when my face was in the frame the model would misclassify my hand gestures, but when my face was out of the frame the model would classify my hand gestures correctly.

A common gesture when playing rock-paper-scissors is to hold it your gesture hand over your opposite hand. This is a something I would have liked to trained the model to recognize, but it was difficult as you have to hold the mouse down to take different pictures on the Teachable Machine website.
