# Homework 4

The model I chose to explore is MusicGen, a text to music model created by Meta AI. MusicGen allows you to generate a short music file based on a text prompt and/or a sample music file or from a mic. This model is a generative model that uses a transformer-based architecture to generate music. Some technical requirements is that I am using the MusicGen Small model, which only generates 15 seconds of music.

Some use cases for this model could be:
- Learning music theory
- Generating music for media (podcasts, videos, etc.)
- Creating music samples

To evaluate the model, I created a small python script that processes a text prompt and generates a music file.

For my first prompt, I said "A rnb happy birthday song at 120bpm".

This is the output:
<audio src="/assets/generated_music.wav" controls></audio>
