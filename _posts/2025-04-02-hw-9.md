This week I experimented with an image classification model and a image generation model.

### Image Classification

I first used the [Microsoft resnet model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50) to classify images.

![Example 1](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/30/realestate/00skyline-west3-digi/00skyline-west3-digi-superJumbo-v2.jpg)

Top 5 predictions:

- breakwater, groin, groyne, mole, bulwark, seawall, jetty: 0.3180
- fireboat: 0.2187
- binoculars, field glasses, opera glasses: 0.1266
- pier: 0.0832
- liner, ocean liner: 0.0790

In this example, the model struggles to identify the image, maybe due the fact that the skyline is further away and the water takes up a majority of the image.
<br><br>

![Example 2](https://d1jyxxz9imt9yb.cloudfront.net/medialib/5442/image/s768x1300/AdobeStock_199226759_429927_reduced.jpg)

Top 5 predictions:

- giant panda, panda, panda bear, coon bear, Ailuropoda melanoleuca: 1.0000
- soccer ball: 0.0000
- earthstar: 0.0000
- indri, indris, Indri indri, Indri brevicaudatus: 0.0000
- gibbon, Hylobates lar: 0.0000

Whereas in this example, the model correctly and _confidently_ identifies the image as a panda. I thought the model would struggle with this image because of the green background and trees, but it classified the image with 100% confidence.
<br><br>

I then wanted to see the model could classify an image that would be more realistic for a designer to bookmark for UI inspiration.

![Example 3](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/33753641/original_ccc6b599f845df3a92070981c4efcedc.jpg?1737113859?bc=0)

Top 5 predictions:

- web site, website, internet site, site: 0.5462
- hand-held computer, hand-held microcomputer: 0.4333
- remote control, remote: 0.0028
- rule, ruler: 0.0011
- cellular telephone, cellular phone, cellphone, cell, mobile phone: 0.0011

Even though the image is an old iPhone UI, the model seems to struggle to identify the image, with the lowest prediction being a cellphone.
<br><br>

### Image Generation

For image generation, I used the [Stable Diffusion v1-4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) model to generate images using text prompts.

I first prompted the model with "A cat and dog on the beach" and it generated the following image:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/web-journal/assets/hw9/generated_image.png" alt="Example 5">
</p>

This image is not very good, as the cat and dog seem to be attached to each other, but the rendering of the beach seems to be pretty accurate. However, this model took over 20 minutes to generate the image on my local machine, I wonder if there are any models that can generate images faster.
<br><br>

### Next Steps

I plan to continue testing different image classifcation models and see if I can find a model that can classify images more accurately. Based on the feedback from class, I also wonder if I can prompt a model to classify an image it a more specific way, not a traditional classification.
