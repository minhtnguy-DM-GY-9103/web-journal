# Homework 3 - Define Your Problem

Try to answer the following questions - just have a stab (we’ll explore methods to get more detailed answers to these questions during our UX focused classes):

- What is the key issue you are trying to address and why is it important?
- Who is it a problem for? How might you research their needs more?
- What, if any, social/cultural factors shape this problem?
- What evidence do you have that this is worth working on? (Even just a hunch or personal passion or a few articles are ok at this point.)
- Why do you think an AI-driven approach be beneficial here over other solutions?
  Then write 5 ‘How might we…’ questions as potential ideas that you might want to work on:
- E.g. How might we [develop remote health monitoring] for [the elderly and infirm] by [using BodyPose detection and LLM API] so that [they are encouraged to complete their physical therapy exercises correctly]?
- Try to get as specific as possible when it comes to any AI-related solutions you include. Again, even just an early attempt to think about how you would use the ML/AI approaches we’ve talked about in class is great!
  More help on problem definition here and How might we’s here (and lots of other research methods/tools!)
